# Virtual Memory Simulator
This project simulates virtual memory management in a computer system, specifically focusing on TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) hit ratio, page tables, and memory frames. The GUI is built using PyQt for visualizing the memory management operations, with backend logic handling TLB lookups, page faults, and memory simulation.

# Requirements
To run the simulator, you need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x (Preferably Python 3.6+)
    
üèÅ Setup & Running the Simulator
Clone the Repository:

bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-memory-simulator.git
    cd virtual-memory-simulator
    
Run the Application:

You can run the simulator by simply executing the following command:

bash

    streamlit run app.py
    
This will open a GUI window where you can input your reference string, TLB size, and frame count, then simulate the virtual memory operations.
